# LeetCode Record in Python3
## Sort
- 876 Middle of the linkded list
> The fast and slow pointer
- 21 Merge two sorted list
> Recursion/ Empty linked list(sorted and return its next attribute)/ Iteration
- 148 Sort List
> Merge Sort/ Middle of the linked list/ Merge two sorted list
- 56 Merge Intervals
> python built-in function(sort, max, min)/ an initial list/ define merge rules(when and which values) 
- 27 Remove Element
> two pointer (reader and writer both start at 0 position)/ in-place sorting/ rarely remove method (swap)(One pointer starts at 0 position, another pointer starts at the last position)
- 179 Largest Number
> override the comparator/ built-in sort fuction/ string comparator (a="400", b="5", compare a+b, b+a)
-75 Sort Colors
> 3 pointers(current position, left boundry position, right boundry position)
-4 Median Of Two Sorted Arrays
> The time complexity should be O(log(m+n))
-206 Reverse Linked List
> Iteration(3 Pointer)/ Recursion(head.next pointer & head.next.next pointer)/ Linked List Pointer Re-assign/ Avoid a cycle
